💡 Features
🔍 Predicts cab demand per zone using historical FHV data
🌦 Integrates weather data to improve prediction accuracy
📊 Evaluates performance with MAE, RMSE, and zone-wise metrics
🖥️ Simple frontend visualization with charts and stats
🚀 REST API for prediction (Flask-based backend)
🔗 Dataset Source
We use NYC’s open public dataset for cab rides:

👉 TLC Trip Record Data

The dataset includes detailed trip-level records like pickup time, location, and more.
